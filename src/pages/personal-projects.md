Over the last year I've been working on a recipe / food shopping list web app. You can find it [here](https://recipeasy.z33.web.core.windows.net/). Just an FYI that it's still currently a work-in-progress. :)

The [frontend](https://github.com/aellwood/recipeasy) is written in TypeScript and uses the Angular framework. The [backend](https://github.com/aellwood/recipeasy-api) is written in C# and uses .Net Core. The project is hosted on Azure and utilises CI/CD via Azure pipelines.
