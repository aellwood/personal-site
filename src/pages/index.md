      I am increasingly interested in content creation and spend a lot of my spare time creating [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClmUNAKtp0lgoWM5kvoYI1A) videos, many of which I have highlighted in my blog. 

      <br><br>
      
      I have also recently started a [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/tofunirvana) channel.
