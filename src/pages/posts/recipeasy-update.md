Originally, when I set out to do my [Recipeasy](https://silly-mahavira-4f9bf8.netlify.app/) personal project, I settled on using Azure as my cloud-hosting provider. I am a .NET developer by trade so it made sense for me to do the backend in .NET Core and I knew Azure would have good support for this since they're both Microsoft technologies. There was a steep learning curve but it was no different from AWS in that regard, which is what I used in my then job. I got the site (frontend, backend and database) set up in Azure and never thought anything more about it.

That was until earlier this year when I decided to try using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as I kept hearing about it on Reddit. I deployed a small site that was auto-generated by [create-nuxt-app](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app) and the process was as simple as connecting my Github and pointing Netlify to the right repository. In less than a minute, my Nuxt site was deployed and on the world wide web! It was amazing but in all fairness, the Nuxt app was a static site and I wasn't sure how well a single page application would work in comparison as Netlify focus heavily on 'Jamstack' in their marketing. The other issue is that you can't host backend or database services on Netlify.

Then enter [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Another cloud provider I'd heard good things about. Disappointingly, they don't mention C# on their site as a supported language but I was hopeful the community would provide. As it turns out, their service revolves around containers so it was as simple as adding a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/aellwood/recipeasy-api/blob/master/Dockerfile) to my .NET Core repo as well as a [yml file](https://github.com/aellwood/recipeasy-api/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) to configure a GitHub Action for the build/deployment process.The final thing necessary was to add my Heroku Api Key to the secrets section of my API repository.
