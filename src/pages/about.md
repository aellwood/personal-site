I've had a lifelong passion for technology - I've been able to build and tinker with computers since I was in primary school. In September 2016, I did an MSc in Computer Science which I loved and set me on the path to utilising my passion in a professional capacity. I've been a software developer since late 2017 and I genuinely love every minute of it! I like solving problems through technology and I also really enjoy working in an agile environment - the only thing better than solving problems is solving problems with talented, passionate and motivated colleagues!

Outside of tech/software my passions include: gaming; calisthenics, yoga & fitness;
and veganism & animal rights. I also speak German.
